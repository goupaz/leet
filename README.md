_Delice_ CPU is the first Microprocessor Of Azerbaijan which is developed by Goup.

We are developing this CPU to implement cutting-edge _microarchitectural_ components/techniques (Branch Prediction, RAS, Pipelining, OoO Superscalar execution, Low-Power Techniques, Multi-Threading/SMT).

_The impossible dream_

Our main goals:
### Analysis power-efficiency, high-bandwidth memory traffic, low cache coherency traffic (mostly Electrical Engineering things).
### Analysis IEEE articles to implementation.
### Implement L1/L2 cache
### Implement Branch predictor
### Implement Pipelining and Superscalar execution (OoO)
### Implement ALU/FPU
